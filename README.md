# Customer Churn Analysis
Project focusing on data cleaning and preprocessing, as well as data exploration and visualization. In this project, you will work with a real-world dataset from a telecom company that includes customer information, such as demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned (i.e., left the company) or not. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis, explore key patterns and trends, and create visualizations to gain insights into factors influencing customer churn.
